- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeeboyEdx
- 👀 I’m interested in PowerShell, Python, and fitness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how about intermediate algorithms and data structures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something not overly complicated that can be a good learning experience and will improve my portfolio.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'm not sure yet.  Can you DM people on GitHub?
